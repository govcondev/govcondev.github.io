**Project Portfolio** README file

**Overview:** My project portfolio will be an accumulation of projects in my young coding journey.

I have just started a Full Stack Developer program through MIT. I will add projects to this folder as I advance in the program to show progression and proficiency for the work I've completed.

**Roadmap:**
+ Finishing the introduction to JavaScript
+ Learning API's
+ Introduction to Databases
+ Putting it all together with our final Project
